# bravebison_task

## setup
To run type:

`python run.py <filename>`

i.e.

`python run.py testfile.txt`

## stipulations

The one part of the task that I am not sure will pass tests is the rover-id key
In the provided input examples, this was not passed in. The way to grab it would be to look through later lines of the
file for the rover-id before sending any line off to be parsed. If requested I can add this logic in.
